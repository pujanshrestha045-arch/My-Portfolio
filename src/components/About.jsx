                    <div className="">
                        <p>I'm a frontend developer with a unique background transitioning from civil engineering. My journey began in
                            structural design, where I developed strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and an appreciation
                            for clean design principles—values I now apply to building exceptional web experiences.</p>

                        <p>My engineering background taught me to think systematically about projects: planning thoroughly, considering
                            edge cases, and building solutions that are both elegant and robust. These principles now guide my approach
                            to web development, where I focus on writing clean code, creating responsive interfaces, and ensuring
                            accessibility for all users.</p>

                        <p>I'm passionate about frontend development and particularly enjoy working with modern web technologies. I'm
                            committed to continuous learning and staying current with industry best practices. When I'm not coding,
                            you'll find me exploring new design patterns, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into the
                            latest web development trends.</p>
